# Ghost Town Mall — Research: Falun Gong & Organ Harvesting

## Falun Gong Principles

- **Truthfulness (Zhen):** Honest and authentic words and actions
- **Compassion (Shan):** Kindness, empathy, altruism, magnanimity
- **Forbearance (Ren):** Patience, endurance, forgiveness under hardship

## Suppression

The CCP declared Falun Gong "opposed to the Communist Party of China and the central government" and that it "preaches idealism, theism and feudal superstition." State media argued that Falun Gong's "theistic" philosophy was at odds with the Marxist-Leninist paradigm and secular materialism.

> Crushing Falun Gong was framed as necessary to preserve the "vanguard role and purity" of the Chinese Communist Party.

## Organ Harvesting in China

Noted as a research thread — potential thematic connection to the commodification of bodies/souls in the game world.

## Thematic Relevance

- A state suppressing spiritual truth in favor of materialism
- The conflict between inner spiritual life and external power structures
- Parallels to the ghost mall's spiritual reality being threatened by the material world's indifference
