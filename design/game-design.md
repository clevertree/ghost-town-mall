## Mechanics Ideas

- **Spiritual currency:** Unnamed, hidden point system earned through "good" deeds in Chapter 1, spent in a later chapter
- **Player choices** noted throughout; may affect physical deterioration of the mall
- **Mall development:** In Chapter 2, the player uses ingenuity to redevelop the mall — choices carry forward
- **Seasonal rushes** as timed events (Halloween, Black Friday, Christmas Eve)
