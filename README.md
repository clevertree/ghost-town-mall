# Ghost Town Mall

Ghost Town Mall is set in present day America. It is a video game set in a mall where there is little business left. There are two restaurants left in the food court, a few shops here and there, a few big names with sales all over. In other words, a mall “ghost town”. Very few people visit the mall during the weekdays, and weekends have a few regulars, but business is slow, and parts of the mall have become more derelict and abandoned.

Ghost Town Mall is a video game about the permanent residents of the mall. They are spirits who, for whatever reason, have ended up “haunting” the mall as it is increasingly abandoned by outside humanity.
