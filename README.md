# Ghost Town Mall

A video game set in a dying American mall — part ghost story, part business sim, part spiritual journey.

Ghost Town Mall is about the permanent residents of the mall: spirits who, for whatever reason, have ended up "haunting" the mall as it is increasingly abandoned by outside humanity.
