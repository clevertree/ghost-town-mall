# Ghost Town Mall — Overview

Ghost Town Mall is set in present-day America. It is a video game set in a mall where there is little business left. There are two restaurants left in the food court, a few shops here and there, a few big names with sales all over. In other words, a mall "ghost town." Very few people visit the mall during the weekdays, and weekends have a few regulars, but business is slow, and parts of the mall have become more derelict and abandoned.

Ghost Town Mall is a video game about the **permanent residents** of the mall. They are spirits who, for whatever reason, have ended up "haunting" the mall as it is increasingly abandoned by outside humanity.

## Open Questions

- What is the plug?
- Where do people's memories go when they die?
- What do people become a part of — the earth? The "ether"?
- Is everything transactional? Dog eat dog?
- Identity shopping vs. identity building
- The need to live in the past and in the future is turned towards procreation — your child is a part of you (the past making up them) and you in the future (a part of you lives on)
