# Ghost Town Mall — Chapter Outline

## Chapter 1: The Mall

First chapter takes place in the mall. Hero and old man. As the mall deteriorates, your choices are noted and may affect how things go down physically.

- We establish that there is another "side" to the mall where ghosts can buy specialized "goods" that are different from what the living need.
- You are rated by your "good" deeds and accumulate **spiritual currency** — an unnamed, unshown point system spent in a later chapter.
- The old mall is in trouble, and therefore the ghost mall is also in trouble.
- Normally a mall closing isn't a problem for the otherworld, but this time some ghosts have become **trapped** in the "ghost town mall" and cannot go "back home" because of a severed connection of some sort.

## Chapter 2: The Investor

The story of a woman who attended business school and wants to "invest" in the mall's real estate.

- It is up to you, in her chapter, to use your ingenuity to develop the mall into something new/different.
- How you develop the mall also pertains to a later chapter.
- **Theme:** "Good business ethics" and what it means to run fair trade.
- **Conclusion:** Good business ethics are a child-like fantasy, made for schoolchildren. The lesson is cynical, illustrated through "business school flashbacks" (raise your hand, what are ethics?).

## Chapter 3: Enterprise

Someone has died! They now have control of the "ghost town mall" and its business.

- The mall is dead, but the new connections in Chapter 2 have given the otherworld residents hope.
- They begin their businesses again, hoping that whatever severed their connection back home will be reversed by returning things to as they were (or better).
