# The Conscious Zombie — Parable / Inspiration

> A zombie's brothers and sisters were zombies as well, running towards the Fortress of Humanity. Humanity was defending itself by tearing those zombies into dust. But then a soul descended from the heavens and fell into one of the zombies, and that zombie started looking around. It froze in place because it saw its brothers and sisters getting destroyed. It saw the suffering — even though the others were not conscious. Now that this soul-infused zombie became conscious, it was a witness to the suffering.

## Key Ideas

- **The witness:** The conscious zombie thought it was alone in its suffering. It fell to its knees and covered its face to suppress the pain. Its first experience was one of total suffering.
- **Meaning from suffering:** Before the body was conscious, the suffering had no meaning. When a soul created a witness, suffering gained meaning. But now that body wonders *why* it was picked to witness, and what that means.
- **Heaven's question and answer:** Why would heaven create a witness? The heavens gave their answer when they sent the soul into flesh. That body must now find its own answer to what the suffering means.
- **The staircase:** What if Heaven sent the soul to witness hell — not to take the highway to hell, but to know what to avoid? The hell was Heaven guiding the soul toward how to build a staircase to Heaven — by transforming the suffering of hell into well-being and peace. Without hell (which existed before heaven), Heaven could not have formed. Heaven sent the soul to turn hell into heaven, because otherwise Heaven would not have existed to send the soul.

## Thematic Connections

- The ghosts in the mall as witnesses to abandonment and decay
- Suffering given meaning only when someone is there to see it
- Building something (heaven/a thriving mall) out of what has been abandoned
