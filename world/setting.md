# Ghost Town Mall — World-Building

## Setting

- Present-day America, a dying mall
- Two restaurants left in the food court, a few scattered shops, a few big names with constant sales
- Very few weekday visitors; weekends have a few regulars
- Parts of the mall have become derelict and abandoned

## History

- Founded as a department store in **~1910**
- There is a hidden plaque in the building (*Today's Special* reference)
- The mall and its premises may have been built on a **sacred site**, which is why the atrium is a "holy" place

## The Otherworld

- The otherworld is accessed via the Mall after it becomes a place of memories, stirred up by modern times, as an access point to the past
- Spirits have become drawn to the portal
- Shops have opened up and accumulated over time in the ghost side
- Everyone who arrives assumes those who have been there before have always been there
- No one can remember a time before the mall (odd, since it was founded in 1910)

## Yggdrasil Connection — "Ghost Town Mall Otherworlds"
