# Ghost Town Mall — Themes

## Suffering & Witness

- Suffering has no meaning until someone is present to witness it
- The act of being chosen to witness — and wondering *why*
- Transforming suffering into something that builds toward peace/heaven

## Ethics & Commerce

- "Good business ethics" as a child-like fantasy taught in schools
- The cynicism of real-world business vs. idealized fair trade
- Is everything transactional? Dog eat dog?

## Identity

- Identity shopping vs. identity building
- The need to live in the past and in the future turned toward procreation
- Your child is a part of you — the past making up them, and you in the future; a part of you lives on

## Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance

Drawn from Falun Gong's three principles (and their suppression):

- **Truthfulness (Zhen):** To be honest and authentic in one's words and actions
- **Compassion (Shan):** To be kind, empathetic, and altruistic toward others
- **Forbearance (Ren):** To exercise patience, endurance, and forgiveness, especially when facing hardship or conflict

> "The so-called 'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle… has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve." — Xinhua

Theme of a state crushing spiritual values because they conflict with materialist ideology. Parallels to the mall's spiritual layer being threatened by commercial decay.

## Fronts & Hidden Economies

Observations about real-world mall businesses that seem impossible to sustain:

- Candle shops, candy shops, kids' clothing stores with zero visible customers
- Explanations: wives of rich men running "hobby" businesses; drug/money laundering fronts; manufacturer-subsidized showrooms; reselling cheap Alibaba goods at 5x markup
- **Mattress Firm** as an example
- Uber / tech companies operating at a loss until competitors are destroyed — "Welcome to late capitalism"
- A BBQ restaurant owner's firsthand account of staying rent-free when the city/landlord didn't want empty storefronts
- *King of the Hill* episode: Peggy's bookstore funded by a rich husband; guns sold from the basement

> "Perfect example of the world is never what it seems on the surface."

These real-world dynamics feed directly into the game's world — ghost businesses, inexplicable storefronts, hidden purposes behind every shop.
